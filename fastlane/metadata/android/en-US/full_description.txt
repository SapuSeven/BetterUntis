Untis is proprietary timetable software. More information about Untis can be
found at https://untis.at. To use Untis, your school must provide it. Your
school must also give you an account with which you can access your current
timetable, though anonymous access may also be available.

Why use this app when there is an official one? The official app is
also proprietary and includes libraries from google and other tracking software.
BetterUntis offers you exactly the same features and even more. Free choice of
themes and dark mode are of course also included.

WebUntis is a non-free network.
